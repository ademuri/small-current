# smallCurrent

This library is an adaptation of the circuit schematics of the
[tinyCurrent](https://github.com/nfhw/tinycurrent) project by n-fuse, which in
turn are adapted from [uCurrent
Gold](https://www.eevblog.com/projects/ucurrent/) by Dave Jones of EEVBlog.

This is functionally equivalent to the tinyCurrent. The BOM is optimized for
ordering from Digikey (easier to source the components in North America). It has
also been redesigned in the free and open-source KiCAD, rather than Altium, so
that making changes is more accessible.
